# 📝 Personal Blog Application

A full-stack *blog platform* built using the *MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), where I — as the **sole author and admin* — write, manage, and publish my own blog posts.

## 🧠 Project Insight

This project was originally started as a *freelance client project, but later evolved into my **personal blog platform*.  
Taking full ownership, I redesigned the UI, optimized the backend, and tailored it for my content needs.  
This transition reflects my journey as a developer — from client work to building something of my own.
